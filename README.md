### Hi there 👋
ℹ️ My name is Dmitry. I am a front-end developer from Russia, Moscow. I am primarily a developer, but I also have a strong interest in other languages ​​(hello python, 1c) and finance (dreaming of a project that changes the perception of ideal applications).

🎓 Currently studying at a [Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation](https://en.fa.ru/) at the faculty of applied Informatics

❤️ I dream of participating or becoming a co-founder of a project that can bring something new to our world. Dreaming is not harmful, not dreaming is harmful
